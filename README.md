# Sleep-Monitoring-and-Apnea-Detection
This project identifies sleep patterns from physiological signals such as ECG or respiration data and detects sleep apnea events. It segments and classifies the signals from normal and apnea episodes through signal processing and machine learning techniques, which can be very helpful in early diagnosis and in managing sleep health.

# 📌 Overview

Sleep Apnea is a disorder that causes breathing to stop and start repeatedly during sleep. The aim of this project is to detect apnea events by monitoring sleep signals and employing signal processing and machine learning techniques.
The device interprets body signals like ECG to identify sleep segments as either Normal or Apnea which can lead to early detection and improved sleep health evaluation.

# 🎯Objectives

To analyze sleep-related physiological signals

To detect sleep apnea events automatically

To classify sleep data into Normal and Apnea categories

To support early diagnosis using data-driven methods
