# Sleep-Monitoring-and-Apnea-Detection
This project identifies sleep patterns from physiological signals such as ECG or respiration data and detects sleep apnea events. It segments and classifies the signals from normal and apnea episodes through signal processing and machine learning techniques, which can be very helpful in early diagnosis and in managing sleep health.
