# 📌 Overview

Sleep Apnea is a disorder that causes breathing to stop and start repeatedly during sleep. The aim of this project is to detect apnea events by monitoring sleep signals and employing signal processing and machine learning techniques.
The device interprets body signals like ECG to identify sleep segments as either Normal or Apnea which can lead to early detection and improved sleep health evaluation.

# 🎯Objectives

To analyze sleep-related physiological signals

To detect sleep apnea events automatically

To classify sleep data into Normal and Apnea categories

To support early diagnosis using data-driven methods

# 🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

NumPy & Pandas – Data handling

Matplotlib – Data visualization

Scikit-learn – Machine learning models

Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

# 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains ECG recordings collected during sleep.

Signals are segmented and labeled as:

0 → Normal

1 → Apnea

# ⚙️ Methodology

1. Load and preprocess ECG data

2. Perform signal visualization and analysis

3. Extract meaningful features

4. Train machine learning models

5. Evaluate performance using accuracy and classification metrics

# 📈 Results

Successfully visualized ECG signals

Detected apnea patterns from sleep data

Achieved effective classification between normal and apnea events

# 🚀 How to Run

Clone the repository

Open Sleep_Apnea_Detection_Colab.ipynb

Run all cells sequentially in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook


# 📌 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how machine learning and signal processing can be used in healthcare to detect sleep apnea efficiently. It can be extended further with deep learning models and real-time monitoring systems.
